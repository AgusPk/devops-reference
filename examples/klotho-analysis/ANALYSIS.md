# Klotho

## Introduction

Klotho is an open-source Architecture/Infrastructure-from-Code tool designed to enable developers to build adaptable systems that can evolve over time.

> IMPORTANT - This analysis was made on 2023-05-16. The service was still in beta at that time.

## Analysis

### Pros

- The tool is very easy to use and the documentation is very clear and concise.
- Innovation, the tool is very innovative and has a lot of potential.
- Access to the underlying auto generated pulumi code
- No SDK libraries
- OSS output

### Cons

- The tool is still in beta and is not production ready.
- Even though we like to have the ability to access the pulumi code and cli, we don't want to do it every time we need to deploy
- Need to install pulumi in you local machine
- Dockerfile is created with root user

## Conclusion

Since this is a fairly new product, even though we see a lot of potential in it, we would not recommend using it in production yet. We would recommend to keep an eye on it and try it out in a test environment. The documentation updates fairly regularly and at a rapid pace, so we expect new thing to come in the near future.
